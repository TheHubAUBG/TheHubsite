Created a Django Project
-IDE i use is LiClipse by Brainwy, with Django Templates Editor add-on to it.
the html code goes in templates/the_hub_site and the css in static/css. So far I have created the ORM for the Members, Smester, and Projects. I still need to add a model for Events, but Events will be a table without any dependencies and relations, so I figured the others were needed first.
